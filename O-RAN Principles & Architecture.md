## General RAN - Mobile Network Architecture

Generally, RAN is a part of the mobile network architecture that connects user devices to the core network.
-> Radio Access Network
- BSC - Base Station Controller & BTS - Base Transceiver Station in 2G
- RNC - Radio Network Controller & NodeB in 3G
- eNodeB in 4G
- gNodeB in 5G

OpenRAN applies to all generations of RAN, including 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G.

Open RAN - OpenRAN - oRAN - ORAN - O-RAN?

a. Open RAN : Movement to disaggregate the RAN components and use open interfaces to allow interoperability between different vendors' equipment.

b. OpenRAN : Either refers to the telecom industry movement or the specific implementations that follow the Open RAN principles.

### What is O-RAN?

XRAN Forum, which is a collaboration of telecom operators, vendors, and research institutions, collaborated with C-RAN Alliance, which was formed by China Mobile, to create the O-RAN Alliance in 2018. 

The O-RAN Alliance aims to drive the adoption of open and intelligent RAN solutions.
Founding Operators include AT&T, China Mobile, Deutsche Telekom, NTT DOCOMO, and Orange.

- When people write #O-RAN, they are typically referring to the O-RAN Alliance and its initiatives.

## Open RAN Concept

### Typical Architecture:

Services
-- -- -- --
Core Network
|
| <- Transport Network
|
Access Network
|
Air Interface
|
User Equipment (UE)

### Usual Mobile Tower Architecture:

- A cabinet of hardware and operating system on the bottom, and a tower to hold the antennas on top.
- Consists of Signal Processing Unit (SPU), RF Equipment, Network Access, and Long RF Cables.

(!) Primitive approach due to the distance between the cabinet and the antennas, which can lead to signal loss and latency.

- During late 3G to 4G, the architecture evolved to move the RRU (Remote Radio Unit) and RF Equipment closer to the antennas, reducing latency and improving signal quality.
- Now, the base station contains Signal Processing Unit, Network Access, and Fiber Optic Cables, with the RRU and RF Equipment on the tower.

### Traditional RAN Architecture:

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJMQnWpLxe.png)

- RRU contains DAC/ADC and RF Equipment, while BBU is similar to the late 4G towers

### Virtual RAN Architecture:

![Screenshot 2025-07-22 200205](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ByDb3ZTUeg.png)

- COTS Server + Proprietary software virtualized for BBU

### Open RAN Architecture:

![Screenshot 2025-07-22 200435](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJgp6Wa8ge.png)

- COTS based hardware (SDR)
- Interface is now open instead of being proprietary
- Due to flexibility on both ends, Open RAN enables free use from any ODM/OEM vendors without brand limitations

### Legacy Model

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SydN0bp8xl.png)

-> More stiff and less modification potential

### Open RAN Model

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJQvC-T8lx.png)

-> Flexibility in hardware used thanks to OpenRAN software (COTS Server)

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJ85Rb6Lxx.png)

-> System still works with different vendors for hardware, and when the software updates, the OpenRAN architecture doesn't block usage.

### Future Developments

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B15AxfaLgg.png)

#### Old Setup (Left Side)

- BBU = Baseband Unit
- RRU = Remote Radio Unit
- Fronthaul = Connection between BBU and RRU
- Backhaul = Connection from BBU to the core network (internet, voice, etc.)

In this setup, BBU does all the "thinking" (processing), and RRU does the "talking" (radio transmission).

#### New Setup (Right Side) — 5G OpenRAN with 3GPP Standard

- CU = Central Unit
- DU = Distributed Unit
- RRU stays the same

Now there are three types of links:

- Fronthaul: DU ↔ RRU
- Midhaul: CU ↔ DU (allows more flexibility)
- Backhaul: CU ↔ Core Network

This breaks the work into three parts:

- RRU: Radio interface
- DU: Handles real-time functions (close to the RRU)
- CU: Handles slower, non-time-sensitive tasks (can be centralized far away)

## Typical Mobile Network Architecture

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 154205](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Skyz1jA8gl.png)

- 3GPP Standards Based Interface to connect end devices to Access Network and Access Network to Core Network, where all services are provided.

- The scope of O-RAN is on the Access Network.

### Basic O-RAN Architecture

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 154235](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byc4ys08ex.png)

Foundational O-RAN setup with minimal components:
- Near-RT RIC (Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller) running VNFs (Virtual Network Functions)
- RU (Radio Unit) handling the radio transmission
- COTS Hardware providing the underlying compute platform
- Simple connection to core network services

### 4G LTE O-RAN Architecture

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 154249](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SkZHkjAIge.png)

This adds 4G LTE-specific components and management layers:
- SMO Framework (Service Management and Orchestration) at the top for centralized management
- Non-RT RIC (Non-Real-Time RIC) for policy management and optimization
- BBU (Baseband Unit) added within the Near-RT RIC for signal processing
- Open Fronthaul M-Plane interfaces (A1, O1, O2) for standardized communication
- E2 interface connecting RIC components

### 5G NR O-RAN Architecture

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 160334](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJIr1i0Lxx.png)

This shows the full 5G implementation with functional disaggregation:
- DU (Distributed Unit) separated as a distinct black component
- CU-CP (Control Plane) and CU-UP (User Plane) split for 5G's control/user plane separation
- F1-C and F1-U interfaces connecting the disaggregated functions
- E1 interface between CU components
- More sophisticated VNF deployment

### Centralized Near-RT RIC Options

Type 1: Near-RT RIC Only Serving 5G
- Dedicated to 5G components only
- Manages O-CU-CP (Control Plane), O-CU-UP (User Plane), and O-DU (Distributed Unit)
- Pure 5G NR implementation

Type 2: Near-RT RIC Only Serving 4G and 5G
- Hybrid deployment managing both technologies
- Handles 5G components (O-CU-CP, O-CU-UP, O-DU) plus 4G eNodeB (O-eNB)
- Enables coordination between 4G and 5G networks

Type 3: Near-RT RIC Only Serving 4G
- Legacy-focused deployment
- Manages only O-eNB (4G base stations)
- Useful for operators with significant 4G infrastructure

### Distributed Near-RT RIC

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 160349](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H10rkoR8lx.png)

This shows a distributed approach where:
- Single physical Near-RT RIC hosts multiple logical Near-RT RICs
- Each logical RIC can specialize in different network functions
- More flexible resource allocation and isolation
- Better scalability and fault tolerance
- Each logical RIC still maintains its own E2 connections to network elements

The distributed model allows operators to optimize resource usage while maintaining logical separation between different network domains or services, providing both efficiency and flexibility in RIC deployment.

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 170524](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Byi1xiCUlg.png)

These three diagrams show the O-RAN Alliance Reference Architecture with its hierarchical control loops and functional decomposition.

## Control Loop Hierarchy

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 194057](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HJweesRUxg.png)

The architecture operates on three distinct time scales:

1. Non-real-time control loop (≥ 1 second) - SMO Framework level
2. Near-real-time control loop (≥ 10ms < 1 second) - Near-RT RIC level  
3. O-DU real-time control loop (< 10ms) - Physical layer processing

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 194046](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJjmej0Ige.png)

### SMO Framework (Top Level)

## Near-RT RIC Architecture

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 200527](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1qOxoCLgl.png)

## External Interfaces

### SMO Connection
- O1 Interface: Connects to SMO for configuration and management
- A1 Interface: Receives policies and enrichment information from Non-RT RIC
- Both terminate at dedicated O1 Termination and A1 Termination points

### E2 Connection
- E2 Interface: Connects to E2 Nodes (O-DU, O-CU functions)
- E2 Termination: Handles communication with RAN functions
- Enables real-time control and data collection from network elements

## Core Platform Components

### xApp Layer
- xApp 1, xApp 2, ... xApp N: Multiple intelligent applications
- These are the "brains" of the Near-RT RIC
- Each xApp can provide specific optimization functions (mobility management, interference coordination, QoS optimization, etc.)
- Near-RT RIC APIs for xApp: Standardized APIs enabling xApp development and deployment

### Platform Services
- Messaging Infrastructure: Enables communication between xApps and platform components
- Conflict Mitigation: Resolves conflicts when multiple xApps make contradictory decisions
- Subscription Management: Manages E2 subscriptions for data collection from RAN functions
- Management Services: Handles xApp lifecycle, configuration, and monitoring
- Security: Provides authentication, authorization, and secure communication

### Data Management
- Shared Data Layer: Provides common data access for all xApps
- Database: Stores RAN data, policies, and operational information
- Enables data sharing between xApps while maintaining consistency

## Key Architecture Principles

1. Modularity: xApps can be independently developed, deployed, and updated
2. API Enablement: Standardized APIs allow third-party xApp development
3. Data Sharing: Common data layer prevents data silos
4. Conflict Resolution: Built-in mechanisms handle competing xApp decisions
5. Real-time Processing: Sub-second control loop capabilities for RAN optimization

This architecture enables intelligent, automated network optimization through programmable applications while maintaining platform stability and vendor neutrality.

## Non-RT RIC Architecture

![Screenshot 2025-07-23 212431](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B18tgsCLeg.png)

### Core Architecture

The Non-RT RIC (Non-Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller) sits within the broader SMO Framework and serves as a platform for hosting rApps (RAN Applications) that can influence network behavior through standardized interfaces.

### Key Components

rApps Layer: Multiple applications (rApp 1, rApp 2, etc.) run on top of the Non-RT RIC framework. 

R1 Interface: The standardized "Open APIs for rApps" interface that allows applications to access framework services in a consistent manner.

Non-RT RIC Framework (orange section):
- rApp Service Exposure Functions: Provides the API layer that rApps use to access framework capabilities
- Inherent Non-RT RIC Framework Functionality: Core platform services that are always present
- A1 Functions: Handle the A1 interface communication protocol

### Critical Interface A1

The A1 interface is the key southbound interface that connects the Non-RT RIC to:
- Near-RT RIC: For more time-sensitive RAN control functions
- Other O-RAN xNF: Other network functions in the O-RAN ecosystem

This A1 interface enables the Non-RT RIC to send policies, configurations, and control information down to network elements that operate on faster timescales.

### Implementation Flexibility

The Implementation Variability indicates where vendors can customize functionality while maintaining standard interface compliance. This allows for competitive differentiation while ensuring interoperability.

#### Integration Points

- SMO Internal Interface: Connects upward to broader Service Management and Orchestration functions
- O2 Functions/O1 Functions: Connect to O-Cloud infrastructure for cloud-native deployment and management

This architecture enables a separation of concerns where rApps can focus on network intelligence and optimization logic, while the framework handles the complexities of interfacing with the underlying RAN infrastructure through standardized protocols like A1.

### Non-RT RIC Framework Architecture

Looking at these five images, I can now provide a comprehensive explanation of the Non-RT RIC functional architecture and its key aspects:

### Non-RT RIC Framework Architecture

The Non-RT RIC Framework serves as a hosting platform for rApps (RAN Applications) within the O-RAN ecosystem. The architecture demonstrates several key functional areas:

### Core Framework Components

Service Exposure Layer: 
- SMO Service Exposure Function: Provides northbound connectivity to the broader SMO ecosystem
- Non-RT RIC Framework Service Exposure Function: Internal service management
- rApp Service Exposure Functions: Direct API access for applications

A1 Interface Functions:
- A1 Policy Functions: Handle policy distribution southbound
- A1 EI Functions: Manage enrichment information exchange
- A1 ML Functions: Support machine learning model distribution
- A1 Termination: Protocol termination for A1 interface

Application Management: 
- App Management Functions: Lifecycle management of rApps
- Other Non-RT RIC Framework Functions: Additional platform services

### Key Interface Highlights

R1 Interface (Image 3): The "Open APIs for rApps" provides standardized northbound access, enabling rApps to consume framework services consistently regardless of implementation.

External Interfaces Termination (Image 4): Shows how external connectivity is managed:
- External EI Interface: For enrichment information from external sources  
- External A1/ML Interface: For machine learning model exchange
- Human-Machine Interface: For operator interaction and oversight

### Implementation Flexibility

The Implementation Variability sections (shown in gray with dotted borders) indicate where different vendors can provide custom implementations while maintaining interface compliance. This includes:
- External interface terminations
- Workflow functions  
- Human-machine interaction capabilities

### Operational Flow

The architecture enables a clear separation of concerns:
1. rApps focus on network intelligence and optimization logic
2. Framework handles service exposure, lifecycle management, and interface standardization
3. A1 Interface carries policies, models, and control information to Near-RT RIC and E2 Nodes
4. SMO Integration provides broader orchestration and management capabilities

## O-RAN Work Groups

## O-RAN Split

### Split Philosophy and Options

#### Core Concept
- Goal: Disaggregate monolithic RAN into modular building blocks with open interfaces
- Challenge: Balance between ideal granular splits vs. practical implementation complexity
- Industry Focus: Three major functional blocks (CU, DU, RU) instead of 8 possible layer splits

#### 3GPP Split Options (Options 1-8)
Protocol stack can be split at different layers:
- Option 1: Above PDCP (minimal split)
- Option 2: PDCP/RRC split (F1 interface)
- Option 3: High RLC split
- Option 4: Low RLC split
- Option 5: High MAC split
- Option 6: Low MAC split
- Option 7: High PHY split (most popular)
- Option 8: Low PHY split (maximum disaggregation)

#### Popular Split Variants
- Option 7.2x: Enhanced 3GPP-based split between High PHY and Low PHY
- eCPRI Splits: D, ID, HD, E, IU splits defined by eCPRI specification
- O-RAN FH: O-RAN Alliance specific fronthaul split

### Link Types and Latency Requirements

#### Transport Links
- Backhaul: CU to core network
- Midhaul: CU to DU connection
- Fronthaul: DU to RU connection

### Bandwidth Characteristics

#### Downlink/Uplink Bandwidth Impact
- Higher splits (1-3): Low bandwidth requirements
- Mid-level splits (4-6): Moderate bandwidth needs
- Lower splits (7-8): High bandwidth requirements
- Option 7.2x: Balanced bandwidth (~25 Gbps max)

### Benefits of Option 7.2x

#### Technical Advantages
- Optimal Balance: Between centralization and RU complexity
- Manageable Bandwidth: Fronthaul data rate ≤25 Gbps
- Relaxed Latency: Less stringent than Option 8 requirements
- Simple Interface: Open protocol enabling multi-vendor integration
- Bandwidth Formula: (IQsize × nLayers × nSubcarriers) / symTime

#### Implementation Benefits
- RU Simplification: Compared to higher splits (2, 6)
- Centralized Processing: Most L1/L2/L3 functions in DU
- Antenna Independence: Bandwidth doesn't scale with physical antennas
- Vendor Flexibility: Easy DU-RU vendor mixing

#### Functional Distribution in 7.2x
- RU Functions:
  - Low PHY: FFT/IFFT, PRACH, Cyclic Prefix
  - RF: DAC/ADC, filtering, amplification

### Trade-offs and Considerations

#### Cost Factors
- Development: Additional interfaces require extra development investment
- Hardware: More splits may need separate hardware components
- Testing: Interoperability verification costs increase with splits

#### Performance Impact
- Centralization vs. Latency: Higher splits enable centralization but increase latency
- Bandwidth vs. Flexibility: Lower splits need more bandwidth but offer greater flexibility
- COMP Effect: Coordinated Multi-Point benefits decrease with higher splits

#### Industry Consensus
- Option 7.2x: Emerging as the standard for DU-RU separation
- Multi-vendor Support: Widest ecosystem support and interoperability testing
- Future Evolution: Potential for dynamic split selection based on network conditions
